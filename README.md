# Thesis
This repo contains my various "proof of concepts" for a pre-processing algorithm used to reduce memory usage on DNA searches, in particular for start and stop codons. <a href="blob/master/PoC-14.py">PoC-14.py</a> is the final pre-procesing algorithm. <a href="blob/master/PoC-14Exact.py">PoC-14Exact.py</a> is the final algorithm paired with exact matching, 
<a href="blob/master/PoC-14Hamming.py">PoC-14Hamming.py</a> is PoC-14 paired with Hamming distances and <a href="blob/master/PoC-14L.py">PoC-14L.py</a> is PoC-14 paired with Levenshtein distances.
