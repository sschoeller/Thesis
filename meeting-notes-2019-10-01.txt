Problem: Given a DNA sequence, 
	(1)	identify end codons for DNA sequences
	(2)	identify start codons for DNA sequences
as efficiently as possible. Would like to do it in less than O(n^2) time; not sure if this is possible.

May be more efficient to identify the end codon first, because it signifies the end of the pattern.

We can take advantage of existing patterns, e.g., 2 of the 3 possible end codons end with the same letter. 

Using two finite automata, possibly moving in opposite directions. Simple divide-and-conquer probably won't work well.

An approximate algorithm may be OK if accuracy is above a certain minimum threshold.

Some questions:
	-	What accuracy rate is "good enough"?
	-	How accurate is the naive algorithm?
	-	How might you partition a DNA sequence to allow multiple pieces of the sequence to be analyzed in parallel?
	-	How can you spread the work across 2 or 3 computing nodes? Can you use the fact that a codon has a length of 3 bases?
	
Oster's idea: Have 3 separate threads work on the same copy of DNA data. 
	-	Thread 1 looks for start/stop codons beginning at base 1, 4, 7, ....
	-	Thread 2 looks for start/stop codons beginning at base 2, 5, 8, ....
	-	Thread 3 looks for start/stop codons beginning at base 3, 6, 9, ....
